    <p><b>Neon</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element">chemical element</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(chemistry)">symbol</a> <b>Ne</b> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number">atomic number</a> 10. 
        It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas"> noble gas.<sup>[10]</sup></a> Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air. 
        It was discovered (along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton"> krypton </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon"> xenon</a>) in 1898 as one of the three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air, after nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide were removed. 
        Neon was the second of these three rare gases to be discovered and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"> emission</a> spectrum. 
        The name neon is derived from the Greek word, νέον, neuter singular form of νέος (neos), meaning new. Neon is chemically inert, and no uncharged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_compounds"> neon compounds</a> are known. 
        The compounds of neon currently known include ionic molecules, molecules held together by van der Waals forces and clathrates.</p>

        <!--Second para-->
        <p>During cosmic nucleogenesis of the elements, large amounts of neon are built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars.
        Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system (it is fifth in cosmic abundance after hydrogen, helium, oxygen and carbon), it is rare on Earth. 
        It composes about 18.2 ppm of air by volume (this is about the same as the molecular or mole fraction) and a smaller fraction in Earth's crust. 
        The reason for neon's relative scarcity on Earth and the inner (terrestrial) planets is that neon is highly volatile and forms no compounds to fix it to solids.
        As a result, it escaped from the planetesimals under the warmth of the newly ignited Sun in the early Solar System.
        Even the outer atmosphere of Jupiter is somewhat depleted of neon, although for a different reason.[11]</p>

        <!--Third para-->
        <p>Neon gives a distinct reddish-orange glow when used in low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs.[12][13] 
        The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. 
        Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. 
        It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. 
        Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.</p>

            <p>Neon was discovered in 1898 by the British chemists Sir William Ramsay (1852–1916) and Morris W. Travers (1872–1961) in London.[14] 
            Neon was discovered when Ramsay chilled a sample of air until it became a liquid, then warmed the liquid and captured the gases as they boiled off. 
            The gases nitrogen, oxygen, and argon had been identified, but the remaining gases were isolated in roughly their order of abundance, in a six-week period beginning at the end of May 1898. 
            First to be identified was krypton. The next, after krypton had been removed, was a gas which gave a brilliant red light under spectroscopic discharge. 
            This gas, identified in June, was named "neon", the Greek analogue of the Latin novum ('new')[15] suggested by Ramsay's son. 
            The characteristic brilliant red-orange color emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately. 
            Travers later wrote: "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget."[16]
        </p>

            <p>Neon's scarcity precluded its prompt application for lighting along the lines of Moore tubes, which used nitrogen and which were commercialized in the early 1900s. 
            After 1902, Georges Claude's company Air Liquide produced industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air-liquefaction business. 
            In December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern neon lighting based on a sealed tube of neon. 
            Claude tried briefly to sell neon tubes for indoor domestic lighting, due to their intensity, but the market failed because homeowners objected to the color. 
            In 1912, Claude's associate began selling neon discharge tubes as eye-catching advertising signs and was instantly more successful. 
            Neon tubes were introduced to the U.S. in 1923 with two large neon signs bought by a Los Angeles Packard car dealership. 
            The glow and arresting red color made neon advertising completely different from the competition.[19]
            The intense color and vibrancy of neon equated with American society at the time, suggesting a "century of progress" and transforming cities into sensational new environments filled with radiating advertisements and "electro-graphic architecture".[20][21]
        </p>
            <p>Neon played a role in the basic understanding of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. 
            Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. 
            Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection.
            Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. 
            Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. 
            Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.</p>

            <h2>Isotopes</h2><hr>
            <p align="center"><img src="Discovery_of_neon_isotopes.jpg" alt="" height="6%" width="15%"></p>
            <p>Neon is the second lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: 20Ne (90.48%), 21Ne (0.27%) and 22Ne (9.25%). 21Ne and 22Ne are partly primordial and partly nucleogenic (i.e. made by nuclear reactions of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment) and their variations in natural abundance are well understood. In contrast, 20Ne (the chief primordial isotope made in stellar nucleosynthesis) is not known to be nucleogenic or radiogenic. The causes of the variation of 20Ne in the Earth have thus been hotly debated.[22]

            The principal nuclear reactions generating nucleogenic neon isotopes start from 24Mg and 25Mg, which produce 21Ne and 22Ne respectively, after neutron capture and immediate emission of an alpha particle. The neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary spallation reactions from alpha particles, in turn derived from uranium-series decay chains. The net result yields a trend towards lower 20Ne/22Ne and higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites.[23] 21Ne may also be produced in a nucleogenic reaction, when 20Ne absorbs a neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron sources.
                
            In addition, isotopic analysis of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope is generated by spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.[24]</p>

            <p>Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after helium. It glows reddish-orange in a vacuum discharge tube. Also, neon has the narrowest liquid range of any element: from 24.55 to 27.05 K (−248.45 °C to −245.95 °C, or −415.21 °F to −410.71 °F). It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity (per unit volume) of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen.[2] In most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium.[26][27]</p>

            <p>Neon plasma has the most intense light discharge at normal voltages and currents of all the noble gases. The average color of this light to the human eye is red-orange due to many lines in this range; it also contains a strong green line, which is hidden, unless the visual components are dispersed by a spectroscope.[28]</p>
